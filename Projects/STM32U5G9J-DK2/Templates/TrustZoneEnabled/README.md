## <b>Templates_TrustZoneEnabled Example Description</b>

This project provides a reference template based on the STM32Cube HAL API that can be used
to build any firmware application when TrustZone security is activated **(Option bit TZEN=1)**.

This project is composed of two sub-projects:

 - One for the secure application part (Project_s)
 - One for the non-secure application part (Project_ns).

Please remember that on system with security enabled, the system always boots in secure and
the secure application is responsible for launching the non-secure application.

This project mainly shows how to switch from secure application to non-secure application
thanks to the system isolation performed to split the internal Flash and internal SRAM memories
into two halves:

 - The first half for the secure application and
 - The second half for the non-secure application.

User Option Bytes configuration:

Please note the internal Flash is fully secure by default in TZEN=1 and User Option Bytes
SECWM1_PSTRT/SECWM1_PEND and SECWM2_PSTRT/SECWM2_PEND should be set according to the application
configuration. Here the proper User Option Bytes setup in line with the project linker/scatter
file is as follows:

     - TZEN=1
     - SECWM1_PSTRT=0x0   SECWM1_PEND=0xFF  meaning all pages of Bank1 set as secure
     - SECWM2_PSTRT=0xFF  SECWM2_PEND=0x0   meaning no page of Bank2 set as secure, hence Bank2 non-secure

Any attempt by the non-secure application to access unauthorized code, memory or
peripheral generates a fault as demonstrated in non secure application by commenting some
code instructions in Secure/main.c (LED I/O release).

This project is targeted to run on STM32U5G9xx device on STM32U5G9J-DK2 boards from STMicroelectronics.

The reference template project configures the maximum system clock frequency at 160Mhz in non-secure
application.

#### <b>Notes</b>

 1. Care must be taken when using HAL_Delay(), this function provides accurate delay (in milliseconds)
      based on variable incremented in SysTick ISR. This implies that if HAL_Delay() is called from
      a peripheral ISR process, then the SysTick interrupt must have higher priority (numerically lower)
      than the peripheral interrupt. Otherwise the caller ISR process will be blocked.
      To change the SysTick interrupt priority you have to use HAL_NVIC_SetPriority() function.

 2. The application needs to ensure that the SysTick time base is always set to 1 millisecond
      to have correct HAL operation.
	  
 3. The following sequence is needed to disable TrustZone:
 
      - **Boot from user Flash memory**: 
         a.	Make sure that secure and non-secure applications are well loaded and executed (jump done on non-secure application).
         b.	If not yet done, set RDP to level 1 through STM32CubeProgrammer. Then only Hotplug connection is possible during non-secure application execution.
         c.	Use a power supply different from ST-LINK in order to be able to connect to the target.
         d.	Uncheck the TZEN box and set RDP to level 0 (option byte value 0xAA), then click on Apply.

     - **Boot from RSS**:
         a.	Make sure to apply a high level on BOOT0 pin (make sure that nSWBOOT0 Option Byte is checked).
         b.	If not yet done, set RDP to level 1 through STM32CubeProgrammer. Then only Hotplug connection is possible during non-secure application execution.
         c.	Use a power supply different from ST-LINK in order to be able to connect to the target.
         d.	Uncheck the TZEN box and set RDP to level 0 (option byte value 0xAA), then click on Apply.

### <b>Hardware and Software environment</b>

  - This template runs on STM32U5G9xx devices with security enabled (TZEN=1).

  - This template has been tested with STMicroelectronics STM32U5G9J-DK2 (MB1918A)
    board and can be easily tailored to any other supported device
    and development board.

  - User Option Bytes requirement (with STM32CubeProgrammer tool)
      - TZEN = 1                            System with TrustZone-M enabled
      - SECWM1_PSTRT=0x0  SECWM1_PEND=0xFF  All pages of internal Flash Bank1 set as secure
      - SECWM2_PSTRT=0xFF SECWM2_PEND=0x0   No page of internal Flash Bank2 set as secure, hence Bank2 non-secure
